# Language & Stack Evaluation

## TypeScript & React (Optimal)
- **Usage**: 907 lines of `.ts` across APIs, libraries, tests, and domain types; 622 lines of `.tsx` cover layout and client/server components.【b7bdda†L1-L22】【e433e7†L1-L10】
- **Fit**: Next.js 14 with strict TypeScript offers type-safe server/client boundaries and an ecosystem aligned with rapid product prototyping.【F:package.json†L1-L32】【F:next.config.js†L1-L8】
- **Tooling**: Vitest, ESLint, and custom coverage scripts integrate seamlessly with TypeScript modules, giving fast feedback loops.【F:package.json†L6-L31】【F:vitest.config.ts†L1-L13】【F:scripts/run-coverage.mjs†L1-L46】
- **Hiring & Ecosystem**: Frontend and full-stack engineers commonly use this stack, minimizing ramp-up risk.

## Tailwind CSS (Adequate)
- **Usage**: Global styles rely on Tailwind directives with brand palette customization to style forms and reader UI.【F:app/globals.css†L1-L14】【F:tailwind.config.ts†L1-L20】
- **Fit**: Utility-first classes accelerate early UI delivery. However, scaling to theming or design tokens may need layering additional abstractions.
- **Alternatives**: Component libraries (e.g., Chakra UI) could reduce custom markup but might constrain bespoke layout or theming.

## Node.js Tooling & Scripts (Adequate)
- **Usage**: Node-based scripts orchestrate coverage aggregation and future automation, leveraging the existing runtime dependency.【F:scripts/run-coverage.mjs†L1-L46】【F:scripts/report-coverage.mjs†L1-L233】
- **Fit**: Works well locally and in CI; however, the custom coverage reporter is tightly coupled to V8 trace formats and may require maintenance when Node upgrades.
- **Alternatives**: Istanbul/NYC could replace bespoke coverage parsing but would reduce insight into deterministic library coverage focus.

## Styling & Asset Bundling (Adequate)
- **Usage**: Minimal custom CSS (15 lines) complements Tailwind for resets and anchor styling.【9dafff†L1-L2】
- **Fit**: For a POC, this is sufficient. If complex layouts emerge, considering CSS Modules or design tokens would improve maintainability.

## Summary Recommendations
- Maintain TypeScript/React as the core stack—it's optimal for the product’s interactive workflows and future AI integrations.
- Plan a path for theming beyond utility classes (e.g., Tailwind design tokens) before expanding to multiple personas/brands.
- Keep Node-based automation but evaluate off-the-shelf coverage reporters once the codebase grows beyond deterministic stubs.
